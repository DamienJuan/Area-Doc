**AREA** (Action REaction) is a web development project made in our third year at Epitech.

The goal of this project is to create a software suite that functions similar to that of **[IFTT](https://ifttt.com/)** and/or **[Zapier](https://zapier.com/)**.

This software suite will be broken into three parts :

- An application server
- A web client to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
